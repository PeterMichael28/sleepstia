      question: 'How does it work?',
      answer: `Inhaling on the diffuser will turn the inside liquids (melatonin, lavender, chamomile) into a light mist which you inhale, and then exhale out your nose. Inhaling the melatonin allows for a near-instant effect, and also allows you to experience the soothing aromatherapeutic effect of lavender and chamomile.`,
